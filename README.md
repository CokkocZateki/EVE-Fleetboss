# Fleetboss

Fleetboss is a tool designed for EVE Online fleet commanders which allows them more
insight into the composition, location and structure of their fleet. It also provides
notifications on possible shortcommings of the fleet and allows fleet commanders to
easily share this information with others.

Fleetboss comes as a complete Django application and is pretty much ready to host in
case you would like to host your own version for operational security.
